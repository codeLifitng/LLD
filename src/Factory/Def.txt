Factory Design Pattern

- When there is a super class and multiple subclasses and we want to get object
    of subclasses based on input requirement.

- Then we create a factory class which takes the responsibility of creating
    object of the class based on the input parameter

- Remove the object instantiation part from the client side (Factory responsibility)

Advantage of Factory Design Pattern

1. Focus on creating object for the interface rather than implementation
2. Loose coupling, more robust code
